# Welcome to the Starter Core Template!

This project is a starter template for creating Carolina-Core Remix apps. This template is not meant for production sites! It is here to help teach some core concepts for those new to web development.

## Development

After you clone this repo  
From your terminal:

```sh
npm install
```
This will install the node modules from the package.json.

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

Wait! What are you doing here under "Deployment". This is a starter template for learning web development. This template is not designed for deployment. We will make another template for that in the future.
